# CSS-3-SlideShow-with-Image-Slider
Images slide along the bottom of the page and a picture background appears when cursor hovers over image.
This project is from a Youtube video:

Currently the pictures don't slide as in the video. I am posting so the creator can examine and advise.
I will update the project asap if I get it functioning properly.
